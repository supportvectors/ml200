# Reading Material

Read the two articles taken from Towards-Data-Science:

- https://towardsdatascience.com/prototyping-a-recommender-system-step-by-step-part-1-knn-item-based-collaborative-filtering-637969614ea
- https://towardsdatascience.com/prototyping-a-recommender-system-step-by-step-part-2-alternating-least-square-als-matrix-4a76c58714a1

## Articles in the directory

For the time-being, I have added the pdf-versions of the articles to this directory (will delete them later).

## Worth subscribing!
I would strongly advise you to create an account on Towards Data-Science (a medium account). This will give you daily access to a wealth 
of data-science articles with a nominal monthly payment. I consider it rather worth the expense, given the wealth of knowledge on the portal.
